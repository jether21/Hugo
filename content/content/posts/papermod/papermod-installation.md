Hi, I’m **Jether Azel**! Welcome to my personal blog where I explore my love for anime, manga, and web development. This site is powered by **PaperMod**, a clean and fast Hugo theme that I’ve enjoyed using to create and share my content.  

My passion for anime and manga has inspired me to not only watch and read, but also to document and share my experiences through this site. I'm always experimenting with design, themes, and customizations to bring the best of both worlds to my audience.

### Why PaperMod?

I chose PaperMod for its simplicity, flexibility, and amazing community support. Whether you're here for anime discussions, web development insights, or simple customization tips, this site is designed to offer clean aesthetics and functionality.
